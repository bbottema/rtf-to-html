# rtf-to-html #

The world's only RFC compliant RTF to HTML parser.

rtf-to-html is available in Maven Central:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.bbottema</groupId>
    <artifactId>rtf-to-html</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

There are **three versions** of RTF to HTML for you to discover:

* RTF2HTMLConverterJEditorPane: A converter that invokes Swing's native RTF support
* RTF2HTMLConverterClassic: The orignal custom (regex-based) built converter with reasonable results
* RTF2HTMLConverterJEditorPane: The improved RFC-compliant parser with the most correct outcome

```java
RTF2HTMLConverter converter = RTF2HTMLConverterJEditorPane.INSTANCE;
RTF2HTMLConverter converter = RTF2HTMLConverterClassic.INSTANCE;
RTF2HTMLConverter converter = RTF2HTMLConverterRFCCompliant.INSTANCE;

String html = converter.rtf2html("RTF text");
```
